# Moore-Penrose-Pseudoinverse
Scientific Computing

## Overview
This package provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for generating random linear data, fitting a linear regression model using the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, and visualizing the results. Built with the `Tkinter` and `Matplotlib` libraries, this tool is ideal for educational purposes and for anyone looking to explore linear regression models interactively.

## Features
- **Random Data Generation**: Create datasets of varying sizes.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance with metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
- **Visualization**: Plot the raw data and the fitted regression line in real-time.
- **Model Persistence**: Save and load models from a JSON file for future use.
- **Interactive Results Display**: View detailed statistical summaries of the model fit.
- **Reset & Clear**: Easily reset data, clear visualizations, or start a new analysis.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface that combines data generation, model fitting, and evaluation in one place.
